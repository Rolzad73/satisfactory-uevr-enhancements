# Satisfactory UEVR Enhancements

<img align="right" src="Resources/Icon128.png"/>This is a work-in-progress mod for Satisfactory intended to accompany Praydog's [Unreal Engine Virtual Reality Tool](https://uevr.io/), to provide VR-specific UI and interaction enhancements, to make playing Satisfactory in VR more practical and enjoyable.

*This mod does not enable VR! It adds VR controls and interactions. You will need the [Unreal Engine Virtual Reality Tool](https://uevr.io/) as well, which runs separately to Satisfactory.*

This mod is now in *beta*, with most game elements playable in VR - just in time for Satisfactory 1.0 to come out and break everything...

See the [Controls](https://github.com/dortamur/satisfactory-uevr-enhancements/wiki/Controls.md) for tips on usage, and check the [To Do](https://github.com/dortamur/satisfactory-uevr-enhancements/wiki/To%20Do.md) for current progress and future goals.
