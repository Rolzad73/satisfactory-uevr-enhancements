# Satisfactory UEVR Enhancements

This is a work-in-progress mod for Satisfactory intended to accompany Praydog's [Unreal Engine Virtual Reality](https://uevr.io/) tool, to provide VR-specific UI and interaction enhancements, to make playing Satisfactory in VR more practical and enjoyable.

This is very much an early prototype, trying out different things to see what works and what doesn't.

See the [Controls](Controls.md) for tips on usage, and check the [To Do](To Do.md) for current progress and future goals

## Installation and Usage

Since this is still very experimental, installation is a manual process.
- Download a release zip file from github
- Extract the contents of the zip file (a folder called `UEVREnhancements` to your Satisfactory game install mods folder. This will be something like `<steam-common-folder>\Satisfactory\FactoryGame\Mods`
- Download the [UEVR](https://uevr.io/) app, and install it
- Download this [Satisfactory profile for UEVR](UEVR/FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.zip)  and load it into UEVR
- Run Satisfactory, and load into your game
- Run the UEVR mod, select `FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping` from the Inject menu, and inject into the game

*Warning: This is intended for testing only!
