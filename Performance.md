For the table below, "Game Size" is a rough estimate of how complex your game save is that you are testing: Small = early tiers, minimal builds, Medium = mid-game, modest builds, Large = late-game, decent builds, Huge = mid to late game with larger builds, Andrew = Mega-builds stretching the capabilities of the engine
