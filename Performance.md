To check your render resolution in UEVR Tools, click both thumbsticks in together to bring up the UEVR Tools settings. Select "Runtime" from the side menu, and it should show the "Render Resolution". 
To show your FPS in UEVR Tools, check "Show Advanced Options", then select "Debug" from the side menu, and check the "Show FPS" option.

For the table below, "Game Size" is a rough estimate of how complex your game save is that you are testing: Small = early tiers, minimal builds, Medium = mid-game, modest builds, Large = late-game, decent builds, Huge = mid to late game with larger builds, Andrew = Mega-builds stretching the capabilities of the engine.

Global Illumination is *off* unless mentioned in the Notes
