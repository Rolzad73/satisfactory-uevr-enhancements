Most actions are doable without requiring additional face buttons, so everything should be accessible for a variety of controllers.

The left controller is focussed on movement, and most movement controls are handled by this controller.

The right controller is focussed on interactions, including weapon aiming & firing, build aiming and adjustments (including nudging), and menu selection.

The right wrist has a menu of selectable options, and also shows build information. Rotate your wrist (like looking at a watch) to see the right wrist menu.
This can be interacted with a number of different ways:
- Point at it with the left controller, and push left trigger to select an option
- Press Up on the right controller stick, roll the stick left or right to highlight an option, and push right trigger to select

The left wrist has some information elements (equipment status, health), as well as the Build Quick Bar, and numbers to select different bars.
Rotate your wrist (like looking at a watch) to see the left wrist UI.
